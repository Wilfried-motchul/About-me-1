        <h2>Software devloper student at Code Fellows</h2>

        <p>Hello, My name is Dawit Ayana. I am a software developing student at Code Fellows. 
            I do not have any coding background, but I am always willing to learn new things 
            that can potentially challenge me so I am here for the long run and I am super excited
            to be a student at Code Fellows. I have a B.A in Criminal Justice from Washington 
            State University. I have had my own business for 6 years in the past. I currently work 
            in sales at Mercedes Benz of Seattle. My goal is to be a software developer in the near 
            future and land a job possibly with Facebook.  

        </p>
